## Types of Noise

### Fast Simplex

An implementation of the improved, faster Simplex algorithm outlined in Stefan Gustavson's [Simplex noise demystified](https://weber.itn.liu.se/~stegu/simplexnoise/simplexnoise.pdf).

### Fractal

A collection of functions to allow any of the noise type functions to be stacked into octaves with various parameters and summed to give fractal noise results.

### OpenSimplex

Due to the [legal status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_noise#Legal_status) issues currently surrounding the Simplex algorithm, [OpenSimplex noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSimplex_noise) was created.
